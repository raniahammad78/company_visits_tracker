        This module provides a complete solution for service companies that perform regular visits to their clients based on contracts.

        Features:
        - Modern Kanban UI for folder navigation, similar to the Documents App.
        - Define visit contracts with start/end dates and visit frequency.
        - Automatically creates a dedicated folder for each contracted company.
        - Automatically generates sub-folders for each month of the contract's duration.
        - A scheduled action runs daily to create visit records based on the contract terms.
        - For each visit created, a placeholder PDF report is generated and placed in the correct company/month folder.
        - Provides a clean, document-app-like interface to browse visit reports.
